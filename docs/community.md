# Community

Rye is a new project and feedback is greatly appreciated.  Lots of it.  Because
of this there are various different ways in which you can engage with either
the developer or other members of the community:

* [Discussion Forum](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/rye/discussions), to discuss the project
  on GitHub
* [Discord](https://discord.gg/drbkcdtSbg), for conversations with other developers in text form
* [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/rye/issues), if you run into bugs or have suggestions

You can also reach out [via Twitter](https://twitter.com/mitsuhiko) or
[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/mitsuhiko.at).
